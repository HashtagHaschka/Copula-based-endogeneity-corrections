The functions implement copula-based endogeneity corrections using the least-squares-based correction function approach, maximum likelihood (PANEL), or MCMC sampling (BAYES):
- PG is the estimator by Park & Gupta (2012)
- 2sCOPE is the estimator by Yang et al. (2025)
- 2sCOPE-np is the estimator by Hu et al. (2025)
- IMA is the estimator by Haschka (2024)
- BWM is the estimator by Breitung et al. (2024)
- JAMS is the estimator by Liengaard et al. (2025)
- PANEL is the estimator by Haschka (2022)
- BAYES is the estimator by Haschka (2022b)

The functions for cross-sectional estimators are similar in terms of required arguments. In light of the current discussion in the literature on the estimation of the cumulative distribution function, 
all approaches considered in the literature are implemented and can be selected via cdf = c("kde", "ecdf", "resc.ecdf", "adj.ecdf")
- kde is the integral of a density estimator used in Park & Gupta (2012) and Haschka (2022)
- ecdf is the empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf) with replaced boundary proposed by Becker et al. (2022)
- resc.ecdf is a rescaled ecdf proposed by Qian et al. (2024), used in Haschka (2024) and Yang et al. (2024)
- adj.ecdf is an adjusted ecdf proposed by Liengaard et al. (2024)

The required arguments should be specified as follows:
- formula should be depvar ~ endog_var1 + endog_var2 + ... | exog_var1 + exog_var2 + ...
- depvar is the dependent variable, endog_var1, etc., are the continuous endogenous variables, exog_var1, etc., are the exogenous variables
- formula accepts -1 to remove intercept
- dummy variables can be modelled using as.factor(exog_var1), etc.
- data should be a data.frame
- Example: CopRegJAMS(formula = Y ~ endog1 + endog2 + endog3 | exog1 + exog2 + as.factor(exog3), cdf = "adj.ecdf", data = data1)

For the copula panel regression model:
- dummy variables must be time-varying because it is a fixed-effects model
- index represents the panel structure and is specified by index = c("panelvariable", "timevariable")
- the panel id variable should come first in the argument, as the model transformation and bootstrapping is done within each panel
- panelvariable and timevariable must be numeric
- data should be untransformed panel data, as the function will perform model transformation automatically
- function will return error messages if the identifying assumptions that can be tested are not met. This includes normality of endogenous regressors, symmetry of residual distribution, and small differences between the residual distribution and the distribution of endogenous regressor(s).
- bootstrapping is done in parallel
- Example: CopRegML_par(formula = Y ~ endog1 + endog2 + endog3 | exog1 + exog2 + as.factor(year), index = c("id", "year"), data = data1)
